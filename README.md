# Advent-of-code-challenge-2018

December 2018 was intense for me) <br>

I'm a newbie in JS <br> 

So I decided to take an advent of code's challenge 2018 and tried to solve many tasks as I could. <br>

I couldn't complete this challenge (most of the tasks was pretty hard), but it was fun and very helpful for me)))<br>
